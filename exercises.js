// Question 1
// Given an array of numbers, implement a function to perform linear search and find the index of a specific target number. If the target is not present in the array, return -1.


function linearSearch(arr, target) {
    // Your code here
}

// Example usage:
const numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
const targetNumber = 7;

console.log(linearSearch(numbers, targetNumber));  // Should output the index 3






// Question 2
// Given a sorted array of numbers, implement a function to perform binary search and find the index of a specific target number. If the target is not present in the array, return -1.


function binarySearch(arr, target) {
    // Your code here
}

// Example usage:
const sortedNumbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13];
const targetNumber2 = 9;

console.log(binarySearch(sortedNumbers, targetNumber2));  // Should output the index 4




// Question 3
// Consider a phone book with a large number of entries, each containing names and corresponding phone numbers. You want to find the phone number associated with a specific name. Write a search algorithm to efficiently find the correct data.
